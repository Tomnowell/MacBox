# MacBox
## A Simple MacOS Virtualization App

### Introduction
MacBox is a macOS application designed to simplify the process of setting up and managing virtual machines on macOS. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to create, configure, and run virtual machines using Apple's native virtualization technology.

### Features and Roadmap
- **Easy VM Creation**: Create new virtual machines with just a few clicks.
- **Configuration Options**: Customize CPU, memory, storage, and (coming soon)network settings for each VM.
- **Snapshot Management**: Save and restore VM states (coming soon).
- **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor CPU and memory usage of running VMs (coming soon).

### Installation
This app is dual licensed: Free & open source (Apache 2.0 Licence) but will be available as a paid app on the Mac App Store soon. The fee is intended to support development and contribute to the annual Apple Developer license fee required to sign apps and distribute via the app store. It will be a one-off, non-subscription charge. In the meantime, you can build it from source.

Alpha/Beta Testing Program:
If you would like to join the alpha/beta testing program, please open an issue on the GitHub repository with your Apple ID email address used for TestFlight invitations. I will set up a more discrete option via MacBox.dev in the future.

To install MacBox, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
2. Open in Xcode.
3. Build and run the project.

### Requiurements
Mac with Apple Silicon processor (M1, M2, etc.) running macOS 14.0 or later.
MacBox is tested on macOS 26.1 or later and Xcode 26.1.

### Usage
Currently, MacBox is a work in progress. Once installed, MacBox automatically downloads the latest macOS recovery image from Apple that is compatible with the device being used.

## Warnings & Some Legal Points!

### Apple's Licensing Terms

At the time of writing, to my best understanding, Apple's licensing only permits macOS to be virtualized on Apple hardware and a maximum of two (2) virtualized instances of macOS may be installed per license. Please ensure you comply with all relevant licensing agreements when using MacBox (the App).
